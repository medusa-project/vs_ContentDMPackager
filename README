The ContentDMPackager takes a ContentDM collection and creates a PREMIS-based Submission Information Package (SIP).  The SIP is structured for ingest into our Fedora-based Medusa repository, but could be useful in other contexts as well, such as transfer between repositories.

The primary input to the packager is an XML export of a ContentDM collection, plus settings specified in the app.config file.  Since each collection is unique the packager supports a pluggable architecture such that you can creater a custom plugin for a specific collection.  The plugin interface is defined in the ContentDMPluginAPI project.  There are also two specific implementations of the interface for two different ContentDM collections at UIUC:  AfricanMapsPlugin and HistoricalMapsPlugin.  Each of these implementations also has its own app.config file which can be included from the main app.config file of the packager application.  

A plugin must implement certain methods that will act on the exported metadata for functions such as to retrieve archival master images or tranform metadata into MODS.  The details can be found in the code documentation.

In addition to the packager and the plugins, this solution also includes several utility libraries that could be useful in other applications.  There is a PREMIS library that creates a class hierarchy that can be serialized into PREMIS XML files.  There is also a Metadata library with miscellaneous functions for dealing with call numbers, mime types, and handle identifiers.  Finally, there is an LDAP library for extracting information from a directgory service that can be used to generate PREMIS agent entities to identify people associated with preservation actions.
